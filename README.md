# Final
Final Project

Curious, Creative, Tenacious(requires hopefulness), and a whole lot of bashing my head agianst this code until it works

**Gameplay ideas:**
Better jump sound and music (done)
different power ups(done)
Change Background (done) + Clouds
New enemies (done)
Big enemy at bottom of screen slowly rising to make player ascend faster

**Bugs**
Can't open background file
Can't add new clouds

**Gameplay fixes**
Platform randomness leaves player in limbo for extended periods
Lower spawn location so player can get out of random stuck situations
Increased width of screen for more visibility
